Portugal Ultra Triathlon is a solidary adventure and a triple ironman. Its mission is to challenge participants' limits and their resilience, generate social value and supporting local communities.  
I was behind the entire internet presence of the event, from the website itself down to the donation system and sysadmin work (setting up emails, custom domains, etc).
